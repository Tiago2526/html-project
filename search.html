        <p>"See your imperfections in your enemies — then crush them."</p><br>
        <p>Incisive Instigator
          Born in the unforgiving Frontier, Dr. Ashleigh Reid - still very much a human - learned early that the only
          person who was going to look out for her was herself. One day, she was hired by a mercenary group for a
          delicate job: steal an experimental fuel source being researched in the Outlands city of Olympus. It was the
          perfect job for Reid, who infiltrated and psychologically manipulated the researchers for years. When the
          lab
          self-destructed, she died.
          And didn’t.
          Her brain was put in a simulacrum shell, but in the process, she lost years of memories, and the trauma of
          her
          “death” caused her personality to fracture. Ash is the embodiment of the cold, perfectionistic, power-hungry
          side of Dr. Reid. But behind that confident facade, something sinister is simmering. After an encounter with
          Horizon that overrides Ash’s simulacrum programming, the framework that kept the vulnerable--yet
          intelligent--Leigh personality dormant has begun to crack. Ash joins the Games to prove she has transcended
          all humanity. Leigh’s determined to prove her wrong.

        <h4>Balistic</h4>

        <p>A refined older gentleman living with a beast inside.</p><br>
        <p>Refined Gunslinger

          August was the sole heir to the Brinkman fortune, built on shady backroom deals. But when those deals caught up with his parents, August was left a billionaire orphan. Wealthy, furious and self-destructive, August joined the Thunderdome Games (the pre-Apex Apex Games). Here, he took the name Ballistic and became a sensation! His style was wild, reckless, and utterly selfish⁠, helping him become the very first Thunderdome celebrity.
          
          He was famed for his iconic CAR (“Lady Grey”, for the tea). It was here, in combat, that August would meet the love of his life, Sok Leng. They would quickly marry and have a son, Nathaniel. Sok Leng and her brother Kit Siang were an inseparable duo of destruction, and with August now in their squad, they seemed unstoppable.
          
          But nothing lasts forever. August’s crowd-pandering combat style meant he wasn’t paying attention to his team when they needed him, leading to Kit Siang’s death. Devastated by guilt, August retreated into himself, driving away his wife and son. For nearly two decades, August lived as a recluse, keeping busy with small tasks to distract a lonely mind. And so August was largely forgotten, though not by everyone. His son, Nathaniel, was both enamored with his father’s victories and determined to surpass them. When his son qualified to join the dangerous Apex Games, August went to the Syndicate with an offer: take me instead.
          
          His son would be safe from the path that ruined him. What better way to use those skills than in selfless service? And if it just so happens to be his favorite activity, killing all who stand against him…That’s quite the fortunate coincidence.</p>
