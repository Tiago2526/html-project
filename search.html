        <p>Incisive Instigator</p>
        <p>Incisive Instigator
          Born in the unforgiving Frontier, Dr. Ashleigh Reid - still very much a human - learned early that the only
          person who was going to look out for her was herself. One day, she was hired by a mercenary group for a
          delicate job: steal an experimental fuel source being researched in the Outlands city of Olympus. It was the
          perfect job for Reid, who infiltrated and psychologically manipulated the researchers for years. When the
          lab
          self-destructed, she died.
          And didn’t.
          Her brain was put in a simulacrum shell, but in the process, she lost years of memories, and the trauma of
          her
          “death” caused her personality to fracture. Ash is the embodiment of the cold, perfectionistic, power-hungry
          side of Dr. Reid. But behind that confident facade, something sinister is simmering. After an encounter with
          Horizon that overrides Ash’s simulacrum programming, the framework that kept the vulnerable--yet
          intelligent--Leigh personality dormant has begun to crack. Ash joins the Games to prove she has transcended
          all humanity. Leigh’s determined to prove her wrong.
